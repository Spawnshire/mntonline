welcome to the midori no tamashi.
this is something that i've wanted to do for quite some time now. i've frequently imagined myself as having a blog but never really had the drive to do so. nor did i have a purpose that i saw fit. however, as my grand ideas of MNT slowly culminate i've begun to realize that i need a hub. so that is the purpose of this site. to act as a personal blog for myself and my fellow creators. i will slowly be bringing in associated acts and will soon begin publish updates on the tbd / wip works. i am truly excited to finally have a means of bringing people together more cohesively. only time will tell what we've in store.

Thanks for tuning into SotW #2! In this weeks entry, I'll be discussing "Street Party" off of Tim Haywood's "Bloons Monkey City" Soundtrack. This song goes so hard. I first heard this song while I was living in Corvallis, OR during the summer of 2021. We would be sitting there relaxing when one of my brothers would say something like "yo' listen to this" and then turn up their phone while playing BTD 6. Everytime they turned this song up the entire house went crazy. Good stuff. Immaculate vibes. I instantly recognized this song as having incredible production and some really meaningful emotion behind it. Once the flutes come in during the second leg of the drop my whole world changes.
  
There's something about this track that makes me really happy but also really sad. I think it has to do with it's association to my brothers. Spending so much time with my family during 2021's summer and then returning back to Bellingham was certainly bittersweet. I had spent a good four years living away from my family with very infrequent visits. Of course during this time I thought of my siblings very much. I thought to myself about how I would spend more time with them if I could. I thought to myself ideas of what we could do together, next. I thought of things that which might make them happy; were I to present them as a gift. It wasn't until I was left alone with my devices where I realized just how important family is. So, when I returned to Oregon to live with my parents for a few months; I finally got to act upon the things I'd been waiting for. We played video games, we went out to eat, we laugh and we joked, and we even told stories we thought were only ours to hear. I certainly would live with my family any day, were my life not already so divided. So that's why this song is so emotional for me.
  
I listen to this cut and think of the great times that me and my family are capable of having. I listen to this cut reminiscing over the days, neigh months that I spent thinking of my family. Just wishing I could be there. I listen to this cut and hear the light that pierces the dark shroud of my life. How the laughter of me and my siblings is far louder than any deep-space rumble. I listen to this cut looking forward, telling myself over and over about the things I need to do in order to provide for my family. This has now become one of my favorite songs for this reason alone. I am happy to be covering this song here as I hope it establishes the purpose of these reviews. I am not saying it is a great or a bad song. I am saying that it makes me feel this and makes me think that. I am not here to speak on music as if I think what's great and whats not. This is my Diary and these are my Thoughts.
  
Thank you, for reading.  
I love you, Marcos.  
I love you, Sariano.

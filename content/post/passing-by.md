These things come and then they go. They fly past my head like scared kittens stuffing themselves into shoeboxes, scurrying away from sight. Might I remember might I not. I can reach like it's a dream soon to be forgotten or I can grasp it like something I never thought I'd remember. There is no say in the things that these people talk about. There is no reason for some of these folk to act so brazenly. For when they do, I am distracted and that great idea I had trails off into the distance. It's almost like I could still hear it too. It's almost like theres an infinitely thin auditory plane. It's almost like if I listen close enough then I might hear these things far off into the distance. Where does my heart go when I hear music so sweet but so faint?
  
Poetry is a form of expression so I ask the silence: What are you hiding? Who do you have locked away? What secrets are you keeping from us? I think it's safe to say that if there was a god he wouldn't be to keen on letting us know. After all that's the way he works; us playing the guessing game. Like green grass growing atop icy hills or warm weather for 366 days: Not happening. Can I get an amen? It's not unlike me to beg questions I don't want to know the answer to. For am I not to know then who am I to blame? God? It's easy to fill in a lack of understanding with the presence of God. That's why arrogant people love him so much. Can't explain it? Must of been God. Don't have an answer? Well, God knows. Well I want to know for myself. That way when something goes wrong I know who to blame. May it be the man yelling louder than any other or may it be an act of nature: screaming child; I know who to blame.

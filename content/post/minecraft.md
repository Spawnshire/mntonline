This is not right and I feel strange. I feel that aspects of the world around me are merging. As if this and that are becoming one. I was playing video games last I recall, but now I sit in front of this computer. I know that I must type. I know that I must tell my story. I know that the things I’ve experienced are important, but I am unable to discern this from that. I do not know where this leaves me and my mind. Why am I sitting here and what is my purpose? Even though all of these occurrences and interactions make so much sense. I still feel so much at odds with whether or not this is what I should be doing. Is it sunny outside or do I sit inside and type? Do I explore lake filled lands of families lost or am I the sole survivor of something more beautiful. I look for the necklace but I am too distracted by the soothing taste of salty prawns.  

I look forward to things hidden from my eyes. I look for a frenzied truth. I look for a new theme to my life and a reason to bounce the tracks. I understand that right now I am viewing my past. It is up to me to make a decision different from which god has predicted but that’d be childish to assume. I lack the output. I must type. I must initiate the I/O.  

Got me; I got you. I got you like and I owe you. I spell truth like: misspelled youth. Subscribe to my minecraft server GaySMP

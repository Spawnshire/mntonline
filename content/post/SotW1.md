I wanted to start off by highlighting this song that has recently become very important to me. Sometime around November 2020, I began going through a really tough time where I often felt like I was no longer the person that I used to be. Sewerslvt’s “Mr. Kill Myself” instantly hit my ears in a way that’s hard to articulate. I felt like I was a child again, like I was playing Dragon Fable or Minecraft or some racing game back in one of my childhood apartments. Instantly I was thinking about Linkin Park, early 2000’s electronic music (techno, rave, dnb, etc.), and countless computer games. It was nostalgic and strong. It was sweet but heartbreaking. It still feels this way when I listen to this song.
  
I often listen to this song while diving, daydreaming and wandering into thoughts of people in my car; who aren't there. Ideas and things that I would like to be doing with people that I would like to have with me. Through this feeling and the first feelings bestowed upon me by this song, I have become marginally more aware of the person that I want to be. I now feel more confident in the type of person that I want to be. Thanks to this song. I am not sure why but I know that I am not alone in this feeling. When I first discovered the song, I was reading Bandcamp reviews and many comments felt the same way that I did when listening. An infinitely nostalgic feeling and realizations of who we are at our core. These are the side effects of listening to artists like Sewerslvt or Snafu in the states of minds that we do. This music, this genre certainly helps me feel less alone.
  
Recently, Sewerslvt has announced her departure from the music industry and it has been a strange feeling amongst fans. It is definitely bittersweet. However, she’s made enough music for me to last lifetimes and I’m confident that at some point, she upload again. Likely under a different moniker but I do have faith nonetheless. Sewer’s departure definitely feels right, though. I know that she needs the time for herself, to grow and to heal. What is so fitting to me: Is that in almost the same moments that I accepted aspects of my past life is when she departed. In almost the same moments that she allowed me to heal through her music, in a moment of deep recollection; I became aware of her departure. Taking my sorrows with her and telling me that it is now my time to grow. It is now my time to become that which I’ve looked up to for so long.
  
It is these things that tell me I’ve run out of time to waste. 
Thank you, Will. For introducing me. 
Thank you, Jvno. For welcoming me.

I have been so distracted and more often then not; I don't know what to say about it. Where and when do I condense my thoughts?

I have thoughts that I can't express. I have thoughts that I don't know how to deal with. I got thoughts that leave me waiting for something more. I have thoughts that justify the purpose. I got thoughts that I'd never know how to say. I got thoughts that make me think of things that are impossible. I got thoughts that make me want to give up. I got thoughts that's braggadocious and reluctant. I gots thoughts impervious to criticism. I got thoughts leavin' me in the dark. I gots thoughts. Thoughts that rock and thoughts that slog. I got thoughts in my mind. I got thoughts in my heart. I got thoughts for my ears but I don't know where to put them. I got thoughts required in viewing. So I gots thoughts and I don't got a place to put 'em. I got thoughts mandatory to viewing. Tell me where to look. I gots thoughts that tell me what's what. I gots thoughts telling me what's right but I ain't gots thoughts keeping the others quiet. I gots thoughts louder than the others and I now I gots thoughts leaving me in the dark. I got dark heart's leaving me with foreign thought. I got glistening darkness that leaves me with something to, something I thought saw. I saw what I want and now I am without thought. Thought that I might go back a couple thoughts. Thought that I could go back a couple thoughts. Thought I saw something hidden in a past thought. But I thought that I thought. Now I've thought. I've over-thought.  

My next step is something that I could never predict. What happens next, I couldn't even predict. I think that a large part of me wants to abandon this blog and start up an editorX page. While the content here is meaningful (to me, at least), I still want to go further than just a static page website. I want breakpoints baby. I want a little more, work. That being said; I am likely going to keep a website up as some means of a diary. I need somewhere to spam my thoughts; but I'd prefer no-one to know it was me :x  

You shall continue to hear from me, whether you've walked past the punchline or not. Sorry if you've been waiting. I've got a bad habit of making others wait :(  

So what's next:
-Register (2) New Domains
-Re-evaluate Hugo Page's
-Develop EditorX page
-(2) Weekly Updates  

I think I'm Ricky, still.  

p.s. i just got questions fo maself, okay?
